# Methods-of-List
we have different types of list in python as:
1. Append(): Adds an item to the end of the list
2. Extend(): Adds all items from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) to the end of the list.
3. Insert(): Inserts an item at a specified index.
4. Remove(): Removes the first occurrence of an item.
5. Pop(): Removes and returns the item at the given index (or the last item if index is omitted).
6. clear(): Removes all elements from the list, making it empty.
7. index(item): Returns the index of the first occurrence of an item.
8. count(item): Counts the occurrences of an item in the list.
9. sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order
10. reverse(): Reverses the order of items in the list.
11. copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.
